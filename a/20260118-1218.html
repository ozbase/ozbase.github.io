<h2>AI Analysis</h2>
<p>
Despite ranking 4th globally in production capacity, the gap with Samsung, SK hynix, and Micron remains substantial. This IPO is not a victory lap, but a capital injection to keep pace in a capital-intensive industry where scale and process maturity decide everything. DRAM is not won by clever design alone; it is won by yield, volume, and time.<br><br>The projected return to profitability signals that CXMT has crossed the most dangerous phase: endless cash burn without market traction. However, profitability at this stage does not imply global competitiveness. It mainly reflects China’s massive internal demand acting as a buffer, allowing domestic suppliers to survive where others would be squeezed out.<br><br>From a geopolitical perspective, this move strengthens China’s memory self-sufficiency, but it does not immediately threaten the global DRAM oligopoly. Instead, it creates long-term pricing and supply pressure, especially in entry and mid-range DRAM segments, where cost efficiency matters more than bleeding-edge nodes.<br><br>In short, CXMT’s IPO is not a market shock today, but it is a warning signal for the next decade. Memory is a marathon, not a sprint, and China is clearly committed to staying on the track.
