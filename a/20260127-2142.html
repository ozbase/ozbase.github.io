<h2>AI Analysis</h2>
<p>## Overview
DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is NVIDIA’s AI-based upscaling technology that renders frames internally at lower resolution and reconstructs them into higher-resolution output using Tensor cores.</p><p>DLSS 4.5 updates the Super Resolution pipeline with a newer Transformer-based model that improves temporal stability, reduces ghosting and shimmering, and enhances reconstruction of thin geometry and fine texture detail. Compared to earlier versions, it focuses less on aggressive sharpening and more on consistent motion handling across frames, which is especially noticeable in ray-traced scenes and foliage-heavy environments.</p><p>## How to Enable DLSS 4.5 via NVIDIA App
DLSS 4.5 can be manually enabled and controlled through the NVIDIA App rather than relying solely on in-game defaults. This allows users to override the AI model used by compatible titles.</p><p>After updating to the latest NVIDIA driver and NVIDIA App, users can open the Graphics section, choose either global settings or a per-game profile, and locate the DLSS Override or Model Preset option. Selecting a specific preset ensures that the new model is actually applied instead of the game’s built-in default.</p><p>## How to Check the Active Preset
To verify which DLSS model is active in-game, NVIDIA Overlay provides a diagnostic view. Opening the overlay and enabling statistics reveals the currently running Super Resolution model and preset letter.</p><p>This confirmation step is important because some games silently fall back to older implementations if overrides are not applied correctly.</p><p>## What Are DLSS Presets
DLSS presets represent internal AI model profiles rather than simple quality sliders. They do not directly change rendering resolution. Instead, they adjust how the neural network performs reconstruction, edge treatment, temporal accumulation, and stability across frames.</p><p>Different presets are optimized for different scaling ratios and workloads, such as moderate upscaling for high frame rates or extreme reconstruction for very high output resolutions like 4K and above.</p><p>## Preset M vs Preset L
Preset M is designed as a balanced general-purpose model. It targets Performance and Balanced DLSS modes, keeping GPU load moderate while delivering stable reconstruction and good clarity. This makes it suitable for 1080p and 1440p output resolutions and for competitive or fast-paced titles where frame rate consistency is important.</p><p>Preset L is tuned for extreme scaling scenarios. It is optimized for Ultra Performance modes and very high output resolutions, focusing on stability when reconstructing from extremely low internal render resolutions. The AI workload is heavier, and it is typically aimed at 4K gaming with ray tracing enabled or GPU-limited situations.</p><p>In practical testing, Preset M often appears slightly sharper and lighter to run, while Preset L prioritizes temporal stability and artifact suppression under heavy scaling. The visual difference can vary significantly depending on the game engine and motion patterns, so side-by-side testing is recommended.</p><p>## Recommended Presets by Use Case
General guidance suggests using Preset M for 1080p or 1440p output, older RTX GPUs, and performance-focused scenarios. Preset L is more appropriate for 4K displays, ray tracing heavy workloads, and Ultra Performance DLSS modes.</p><p>Because DLSS behavior depends heavily on each title’s implementation, switching presets and evaluating both image quality and frame rate per game remains the most reliable approach.</p><p>## Final Thoughts
DLSS 4.5 represents a refinement rather than a radical redesign, emphasizing stability, reduced artifacts, and higher-quality reconstruction through its updated Transformer model.</p><p>The NVIDIA App’s override system gives users granular control over which AI model is used, making Preset M the practical default for most players and Preset L a specialized option for extreme resolution scenarios.</p>
